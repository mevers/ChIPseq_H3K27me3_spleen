# Snakemake rules involving bedtools
# http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
#
# Beware: bedtools has changed significantly from version 2.24
# and above. For example, bedtools coverage -a <a.bed> -b <b.bed>
# determines the overlap of a relative b in version <=2.24, whereas
# it determines the overlap of b relative to a in version >=2.25.
# Furthermore, bam file input (instead of bed) is inconsistent,
# and seems to have changed from version to version.
#
# Note: This rule file should be included in bam.rules.
# Global variables (e.g. directory paths) should be declared in
# bam.rules and are passed down to the individual tool rule files!
